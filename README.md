# RedditQuestions
Code for answering questions on Reddit

# What is the purpose of this repository?
The purpose of this repository is to keep a record of all the code I write as part of helping people on the [Reddit website](https://reddit.com) in the various subreddits dedicated to the [he R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). As of this edit, the Reddit R groups I follow are shown here.
1. [/r/rprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/rprogramming/)
1. [/r/rlanguage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/)
1. [/r/rstats](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/)
1. [/r/RStudio](https://www.reddit.com/r/RStudio/)

# A note about the RStatistics Subreddit
In 2018, the [/r/rstatistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/RStatistics/) subreddit was created with the hopes of uniting the four subreddits listed above. When the *RStatistics* subreddit was created, the hope was that it would replace the subreddits 1-3 above, the reason being that there are no obviously clear criteria for which subreddit to use for "*general*" R questions. Often, these questions even get posted to [/r/RStudio](https://www.reddit.com/r/RStudio/) because beginners are not sure where *R* itself ends and *RStudio* begins.

The rationale for creating [/r/rstatistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/RStatistics/) was a good one. However, this subreddit has almost no content, which I believe is due to two primary factors.

1. The participants of the existing subreddits did not rally behind [/r/rstatistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/RStatistics/).

1. The creators of [/r/rstatistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/RStatistics/) required that anyone submitting a post be approved by moderators. Although this policy is a great idea for maintaining high quality standards for posts, it has the disastrous effect of discouraging any posts at all.
